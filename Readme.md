# Image Processing Exploration

This repository contains Python notebooks for exploring various image processing concepts.

## Files

* **arithmeticCoding.ipynb:** This notebook implements arithmetic coding, a form of entropy encoding used for lossless data compression.
* **bitSlicing.ipynb:** This notebook covers bit slicing, a technique for manipulating multiple bits of data simultaneously.
* **cvBasics.ipynb:** This notebook introduces computer vision (cv) and explores the simple operations on an image such as grayscale generation and layer seperation.
* **histEqualiser.ipynb:** This notebook implements histogram equalization, a technique for improving the contrast of an image.
* **lena.png:** The primary image used throughout the notebooks.
* **output_image_with_name.jpg:** The output image generated by one of the notebooks.
* **shanonFanoCompression.ipynb:** This notebook implements Shannon-Fano coding, another form of entropy encoding used for lossless data compression.
* **tambolaTicket.ipynb:** This notebook deals with image generation or manipulation related to tambola tickets.

## Concepts Covered

* **Image Compression:** The notebooks `arithmeticCoding.ipynb` and `shanonFanoCompression.ipynb` explore how to compress images using lossless techniques.
* **Image Manipulation:** Several notebooks cover techniques for manipulating digital images, such as changing the contrast, brightness, or applying filters.
* **OpenCV:** The `cvBasics.ipynb` notebook introduces OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision and image processing in Python.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install opencv-python pillow`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook application and navigate to the directory containing this repository.
4. Open any of the `.ipynb` files to start working on the image processing concepts covered in that notebook.

## Further Exploration

These notebooks provide a starting point for exploring image processing in Python. OpenCV offers a vast range of functions for computer vision tasks.
